# RoomManager
Room Manager is an IOT application that aims to monitor and control sensors and actuators in a house.
In particular, it allows you to check the brightness and temperature levels of each room in a building, and to automate the activation of lights or thermostats.
In addition, there are some specific operating modes that allow, among other things, to optimize the energy management of the building.

Technology stack: C++ (per Arduino MKR 1000), Angular, Node.js, MySQL, MQTT.
